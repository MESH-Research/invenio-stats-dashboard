# TODOs

- [ ] ensure that dependent PRs are merged in invenio-requests and invenio-rdm-records
- [ ] decide whether to rename the package `invenio-community-stats`
- [x] add config flag to switch UI between test data and production data
- [ ] testing
  - [ ] move all tests from centralized KCWorks test suite into this package
  - [ ] fix failing tests
  - [ ] expand test coverage
- [ ] search indexing
  - [ ] add dynamic creation of index templates based on subcount configurations
  - [ ] make view and download event factories use the subcounts configuration
- [ ] aggregation
  - [x] refactor CommunityUsageSnapshotAggregator for the enriched event document structure
  - [x] ensure CommunityUsageDeltaAggregator can handle large volumes of records gracefully (paginate the query, batch the aggregations)
  - [x] get tests for aggregator classes working
  - [ ] get tests for queries working with refactored code
  - [ ] set up a check in aggregator classes to ensure that view/download event migration has been completed before running the aggregator tasks
  - [ ] set up automatic triggering of the startup tasks (index community events, migrate usage events) when the aggregators first run
  - [ ] add opensearch health and memory usage checks to the aggregator classes (as in the reindexing service) and quit out gracefully if necessary
  - [ ] evaluate the viability of the "published" record aggregators (currently not working because of inherent issue of published dates being retroactive)
- [ ] UI components
  - [x] add proper loading states to the dashboard components
  - [x] add an updated timestamp to the dashboard views
  - [x] fix state problems with chart views
  - [ ] add custom date range picker to the dashboard views
  - [ ] add ReactOverridable support for each of the React components
  - [ ] add mechanism for adding custom React components to the dashboard views (entry point providing file paths and component labels, to be imported in components_map.js?)
  - [ ] evaluate whether additional default components are needed
  - [ ] add `invenio-communities` custom field to provide per-community configuration of the dashboard layout
- [ ] client-side data handling
  - [ ] add client-side caching of the stats data to display while new data is loading (current implementation with IndexedDB is not working)
  - [ ] update client-side data transformer to use the configurable subcounts
- [ ] UI theming
  - [x] move default CSS into this package
  - [x] finish basic theming of the global dashboard view
  - [ ] harmonize default CSS with InvenioRDM defaults
  - [ ] improve mobile responsiveness of the dashboard views
- [ ] API requests
  - [ ] implement security policy for API queries
- [ ] reporting
  - [ ] implement report generation (via API request? via email? generated client-side?)
  - [ ] enable report download from dashboard widget
- [ ] improve documentation
